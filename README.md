This is a hobby project.

This project contains implementations of various monadic structues, as well as functional interfaces for pre-existing .NET functions.

You are free to use the code found in this repository in any way you wish. It should however be noted that the code is not well tested or documented, and as such not recommended for serious use. No guarantees are made regarding backward-compatibility, as I may change anything at a whim, at any point in time.
